*Hello, and welcome to one of the 2024 McMaster GDSC Open Source project repos! Project Lead: [Kristian Diana](https://github.com/kristiandiana).*



## :loudspeaker: Attention :bangbang:

If **you** are interested in learning about how AI can be used a difference in the healthcare field, then you are in the right place! Whether you are interested in machine learning, web development, or API development, this project has something for you! 

## Project Overview :page_with_curl: 

The **ocular disease identifier** project involves developing an AI model that can predict whether common ocular diseases are present in a fundus image (see *Figure 1*). A user-friendly web application will be developed to provide easy access to the model.

<br/>

The team will comprise of two sub-teams; the Frontend sub-team, and the Backend sub-team. As a brief summary, the main focus of each sub-team is as follows. The Frontend sub-team is responsible for the development of the web application, as well as an API using a Python framework. The Backend sub-team is responsible for the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow. The model is to be trained using a publicly sourced dataset. For more information about the project, please see the attached [Project Roadmap](./PROJECT-ROADMAP.md) which includes a detailed [Sprint Plan](./PROJECT-ROADMAP.md#sprint-planning) and proposed [Tech Stack](./PROJECT-ROADMAP.md#tech-stack) for the project.




## Available Developer Positions :busts_in_silhouette:

There will be ***3 available positions for each of the two sub-teams*** indicated above (6 total). As a side note, being assigned to a specific sub-team does **not** necessarily mean you will not learn about the other, however it **is** where the bulk of your contributions will be made. 

This position will provide you with relevant experience that will help you stand out to recruiters. I am looking for individuals who will put in consistent effort and who are eager to learn! Apply to this team to have your work displayed in the contributions table below!
